# Agents

This project uses the Payload CMS skill at `.agents/skills/payload/`.
Start with `.agents/skills/payload/SKILL.md` for a quick reference, then see `.agents/skills/payload/reference/` for detailed docs.

Browser testing uses Playwright:

- Official CLI skill: `.agents/skills/playwright-cli/`
- App-specific frontend testing: `.agents/skills/playwright-frontend/`
- MCP server: `.cursor/mcp.json` (`npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest`)

Install or refresh the official skill with `playwright-cli install --skills=agents`. Reload MCP in Cursor Settings after changing `.cursor/mcp.json`.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
